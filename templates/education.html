                <p>Performed research on the development of detection methods and microfluidic devices
                    for phosphate detection in water. Took courses in deep learning, machine learning,
                and advanced statistical methods.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Developed an iOS application to colorimetrically quantify phosphate levels based on
                      measured RGB values</li>
                  <li>Created an infrared box with 850nm emitters in order to take advantage of the absorption
                  peak in the Molybdenum Blue method. Imaged the box using a NoIR camera with a Raspberry Pi.
                  RAW Bayer data was used to calibrate and measure different phosphate test strips</li>
                  <li>Built an online data center to interface with the colorimetry app. The data center could
                  be used to easily collect phosphate measurements from various devices in various locations across
                  Rhode Island</li>
                  <li>Developed a fluorescent paper-based phosphate test strip using Europeum spotted carbon
                      nano dots. Constructed a UV-Vis box with an excitation wavelength of 370nm. Measured
                  fluorescence based on RGB values</li>

                <p>Spent the last year of my Bachelors abroad in Germany as part of the International Engineering
                    Program at URI. Half a year was spent at TU Darmstadt developing language and technical skills
                in German. The other half was spent interning for Porsche's Electric Powertrains and Transmissions
                R&D Division in Weissach.</p>
